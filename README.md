This is the repository for my Thesis topic while at Northern Illinois University (NIU). The .mos file is Fico Xpress solver which was used to code the optimization engine for solving the None Linear Mixed Integer Program, the Dynamic Programming algorithm, Lagrangian Relaxation (LR) algorithm and the Greedy Heuristircs for solving the sub-problems.

The code has been segregated into sub-routines for each segment. A global routine will call each sub-routine and passes the parameters into other parts of the code.
